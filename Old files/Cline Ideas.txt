Cline Ideas:
2 isolated populations that then intermix with a reproduction barrier (sigmoidal curve of allele frequency) between them

1) genetic (heterozygotes between populations are less fit and die off)
	requires genetic incompatibility/local adaptations
	might require multiple simulations, one spatial and one non-spatial
2) environment (physical barrier between populations)
	requires variance in maps
3) dispersal barrier

Control - Does age-structure (life cycle) matter?
	Juveniles smaller, not fully motile but moved by currents, must find location to settle
	Once adults settle then they can grow, but cannot move

## Notes for the life stages

2 life stages: adults and juveniles.

Simulation starts with the adults. They have a fixed survival probability (for now, this can be expanded in future models, e.g., making it conditional on environmental variables over space), a small reproduction interaction distance, high fecundity, and no dispersal. They mate and produce the next life stage.

Juveniles have a (for now) fixed survival probability (likely lower than the adults), no reproduction, and high dispersal. After some time (how much?), they can transition into adults. For this, they have to settle. Settlement is limited by the carrying capacity (can be further expanded with other variables at a later stage).
