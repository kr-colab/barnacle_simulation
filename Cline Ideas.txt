Cline Ideas:
2 isolated populations that then intermix with a reproduction barrier (sigmoidal curve of allele frequency) between them

1) genetic (heterozygotes between populations are less fit and die off)
	requires genetic incompatibility/local adaptations
	might require multiple simulations, one spatial and one non-spatial
2) environment (physical barrier between populations)
	requires variance in maps
3) dispersal barrier
