# Barnacle sims paper

## 2024-09-04

Meeting with Peter, ideas:

* “Here is a simulation!” - how to model this complex stuff?
* John’s cline data ([Wares et al. 2021 JoB](https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14142)): What is (effective) migration across a given habitat gap?
  * How does it depend on a few variables? (Habitat gap, migration bias, environment, etc)
  * Needs currents?
* See under what conditions do you get local adaptation?
  * Like height, like in the real barnacles?
* Scaling? How to do it? Does it work okay?
  * See [Ferrari et al. 2024 bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.27.591463)
* How big can we sim? (w/o scaling)

Meeting with Jiseon. Yes, let's try and do the more straightforward paper of "Here's a barnacle sim!". 

TODO: Confirm with Peter

Things to do for the sim:

1. Consolidating recent changes. Making sure the script in the repo is clean and works.
2. Add summer map (using existing Illustrator map)
3. Add map/environmental data from Dave Sutherland (contacting him for access to data, plus meeting?)
4. Scaling population size

Longer term TODOs for the paper: What should our "results" be? Genetic distance? Local adaptation?
