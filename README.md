# barnacle_simulation
We are building a biologically and ecologically realistic SLiMulation of barnacles. 

Goal 1 (Nov 6) - Make barnacles live in the water. 
Goal 2.0 (Nov 13) - Figure out the ubuntu situation...
Goal 2 - Make an IBD (isolation-by-distance) plot
Goal 3 - North/South clines

After SLiM 4.1 release
- Implement life cycle
- Seasonality
- Others...
- 

Variables to (possibly) focus on
- North/South clines
- Salinity
- Isolation-by-distance
- Coastal ecosystem?

Building our own SliMulation top down
- genome (lenght, recombinations)
- dispersal
- reproduction
- map -> fitness, dispersal
- output (e.g. tree sequences)
