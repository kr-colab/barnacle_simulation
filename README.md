# Barnacle simulation
We are building a biologically and ecologically realistic SLiMulation of barnacles. 

# Goals:
## 1. Smaller map, higher resolution, Oregon Coast
## 2. Build our own SLiMulation top down
- genome (lenght, recombinations)
- dispersal
- reproduction
- map -> fitness, dispersal
- output (e.g. tree sequences)

## 3. Make an IBD (isolation-by-distance) plot
## 4. North/South clines


# After SLiM 4.1 release
- Implement life cycle
- Seasonality
- Others...
- 

# Variables to (possibly) focus on
- North/South clines
- Salinity
- Isolation-by-distance
- Type of coastal ecosystem?
- Presence of predators?

# Preparation for summer
- Refresher on SLiM in general
- find relevant data from Dave Sutherland's lab, read some literature on modeling Coos Bay currents. Specifically, are there maps we can use to make a velocity field map for SLiM? Reach out to Dave Sutherland.
- Find out how to implement genetic aspect of adaptation/divergence (Jiseon will look into SLiM literature) in our SLiM script
