# barnacle_simulation
We are building a biologically and ecologically realistic SLiMulation of barnacles. 

Goals:
1. Smaller map, higher resolution, Oregon Coast
2. Build our own SLiMulation top down
- genome (lenght, recombinations)
- dispersal
- reproduction
- map -> fitness, dispersal
- output (e.g. tree sequences)
Goal 3 - Make an IBD (isolation-by-distance) plot
Goal 4 - North/South clines

After SLiM 4.1 release
- Implement life cycle
- Seasonality
- Others...
- 

Variables to (possibly) focus on
- North/South clines
- Salinity
- Isolation-by-distance
- Type of coastal ecosystem?
- Presence of predators?
