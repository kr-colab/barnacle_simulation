# Barnacle simulation
We are building a biologically and ecologically realistic simulation of the population genomics of the Pacific acorn barnacle (*Balanus glandula*) using SLiM 4.3.

This starts with modeling the accurate life stages, behavior, and reproduction of *B. glandula* across the estuary of Coos Bay, Oregon. Following this, we layer environmental variables such as salinity and temperature onto our model of the bay, and then account for the effects of these variables on our population. Our current work is implementing local adaptation to these variables and testing how our population evolves over times. Included in this repository is the SLiM file, the the maps used to account for environmental variables, and the log files we use for data analysis. Stick around to see how this project shapes up!
